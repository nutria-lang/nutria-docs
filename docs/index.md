# Introduction

Nutria is a modern programming language. It inherits best ideas from strongly-typed languages like Go as well as dynamic, interpreted languages like Python.
It helps you to think clearly and express ideas as fast as possible with safety measures to avoid bugs. We promise you will smile while using Nutria :)

Thinking in Python leaves strong types to provide greater flexibility. On the other hand, Go is a bitter pill for people who comes from Object-oriented programming world.
We believe languages should give a natural way to express ideas for humans. Therefore Nutria is a general-purpose programming language that brings best of multiple paradigms
without leaving pragmatic thinking.

## Highlights of Nutria:

* Small language like Go
* General-purpose with support for functions and classes
* Dynamic & Interpreted for faster feedback loops
* Designed for Readability & Memorability
* A single-binary interpreter
* Developer focused language with most frequently used batteries
* Less typing with idiomatic keywords (`fun`, `pkg`, `pub` etc.)
* REPL-friendly for interactive play & test
* Prefers mathematical symbols (&&) over verbose words (and)
* Uses `assert` based type checking for function arguments
* Supports `public` and `private` access modifiers for class methods

## Why name Nutria for a language ?

Nutria is a mammal from rodent family, which is hated so much for being an invasive species. We like to give back some love and respect.
Because Nutria is very much inspired from Go, it is also apt to have an animal which is a close species.
